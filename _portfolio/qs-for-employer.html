<p>When I prepare for the job interview, questions for the interviewer pop-up in my head naturally.</p>

<p>But I also notice good questions being asked when the tables are flipped and I am an interviewer as well as noting good examples from the articles and discussions I read. This is how this list came about.</p>

<p>I usually look though this list before my interviews and copy the questions which I feel like asking into my notebook. This way I make sure that questions that I really want to ask are in my active memory.</p>
