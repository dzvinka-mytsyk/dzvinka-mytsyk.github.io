    <p>This example contains the pdf file with Product Backlog example
      for the IT System I was helping to create
    (all the specific customer details are excluded).</p>

    <p>The format of Product Backlog is quite usual, however the popular template of User Stories
       ("As a ... I want ... so that ...") was ommited.</p>

    <p>You can also review the Product Vision Statement and
      future Roadmap examples corresponding to the same development project
         <a href="/portfolio/product-vision-roadmap.html">here</a>.</p>
