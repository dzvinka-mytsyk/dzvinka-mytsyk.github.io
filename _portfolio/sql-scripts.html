<p>Khowledge of SQL is a great skill to have as IT Business Analyst or Product Owner.</p>

<p>Based on set theory, SQL gives Business Analyst the authonomy to explore data model,
  product domain and (to some extent) buisness processes, at the same time allowing to
  get useful insights, create quick reports as well as comprehensive test cases. </p>

<p>In the scripts below I show the examples of solving some real live data tasks
  from the FinTech and ERP domains. Please note that provided DB tables and schemas
  are tremendously simplified and contain only the data necessary for the examples
  (and maybe a little more for the reacher context).</p>
