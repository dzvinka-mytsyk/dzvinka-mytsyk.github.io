    <p>There are essentially two types of software projects which Business Analyst (BA) can join:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="margin-btm-10">the one with already existing software Product which has some sort of Architecture and
          Domain Model already in place and couple of releases under the belt; or</li>
        <li class="margin-btm-10">completely new Product development where scoping, Domain Modeling, initial Architecture
          and Design are yet to be done.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Usually the latter option is far more complex for BA. So to navigate these uncharted waters
        I use several techniques, one of which is "New Project questions list for BA". On this page
        you can download an example of such questionnaire.</p>
