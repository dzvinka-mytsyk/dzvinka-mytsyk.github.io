<p>One of the elements of Agile and Lean software development is constant improvement
and adaptation. But how can we improve if we don’t know the “current state of affairs” in
interested areas? And here, at this point, metrics step into the game.</p>

<p>Metrics help measure different aspects of the development process, visualise progress,
keep track of goals, measure efficiencies, etc.</p>

development context and touch on what insides (if applied correctly) they might provide.</p>
