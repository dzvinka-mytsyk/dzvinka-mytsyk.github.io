<p>When looking for a new IT Business Analyst to join the team, sometimes interviews pop up in the calendar very unexpectedly and at the last minute.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s why I created a list of questions which I keep handy and can use as a basis when meeting a candidate.</p>

<p>Every interview is unique, but having such template helps me structure the conversation and remember good questions that suit to the context of a particular interview.</p>
