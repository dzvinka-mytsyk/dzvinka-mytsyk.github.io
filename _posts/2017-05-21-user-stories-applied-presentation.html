  <p class="blog-emphasis">
    The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/User-Stories-Applied-Software-Development/dp/0321205685" target="_blank"> "User Stories Applied" </a> written by Mike Cohn is one of the best books I have read on a subject of being a Product Owner and building Software Products with Agile methodologies.
  </p>
  <p>
    While researching this book before reading it, I found this presentation created by Mike Cohn which and available free on Mike's website:
    <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/uploads/presentations/User-Stories-Applied-Agile-Software-Development-XP-Atlanta-2004.pdf" target="_blank"> "User-Stories-Applied-Agile-Software-Development-XP-Atlanta-2004.pdf"</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    This presentation contains so many useful and insightful ideas from the book itself that I would recommend it to anyone who would like the overview of the book without investing the time into reading it. Presentation contains 63 slides, but it is still significantly faster to read than 260+ page book :)
  </p>

  <p>
    And as per usual I created a
    <a href="/assets/docs/by-others/User-Stories-Applied-Agile-Software-Development-XP-Atlanta-2004.pdf">PDF copy</a>
    of this presentation in case something were to happen with an online version or a link.
