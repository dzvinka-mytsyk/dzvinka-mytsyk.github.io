<p class="blog-emphasis">

  <strong> "30 lessons I learned managing people for the first time" </strong> is a checklist of possible pitfalls in management.

Expecting anything more has a high chance of catalyzing impostor syndrome."

  "In the world of big data, the surrounding hype has spawned a brand-new lingo. Need a little clarity? Read on for a glossary of sorts highlighting some of the main data types you should understand."
