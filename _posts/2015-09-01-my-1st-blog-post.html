  <p class="blog-emphasis">
    This is my first blog post on this web-site. It probably won't be charged with information too much :)
    Rather it will be "charged with intention".
  </p>

  <div class="divide20"></div>
  <p >
    I will be using this blog to share my latest portfolio items, some new ideas which not yet have gotten
    into portfolio-item-form and maybe just my thoughts on IT-related topics.
  </p>
  <p >
  Subjects I plan to discuss in near future include:
    <ul class="icon-list list-unstyled">
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> Communication in IT</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> Tricks for personal knowledge management</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> Personal time management with Kanban</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> Agile methodologies implementation</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> Various aspects of Product Management</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> User eXperience and so on...</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    Hope you'll find them interesting and useful. Come back soon!
