  This is another good articles exploring the topic of "fluidity" of Product Manager's role in varying contexts of different projects, business models and stages of Product Development Life-cycle.

  Lately I've been refreshing some of my JavaScript knowledge lately. And this article very accurately reflects on some of the worse moments of changes that JavaScript and web-development underwent since those times that I was (sort of) a web-developer myself.

<p>Very good intro to the topic of "getting hired in Product Management for the first time", but not just that. This post also contains tonnes of useful links to other PM-blogs, guides, experts to follow and podcasts. I added some to my own subscriptions list.</p>
