  <p class="blog-emphasis">
    Inspired by <a href = "https://youtu.be/6K4ljFZWgW8" target="_blank">Mary Poppendieck's talk</a> (which I shared in my earlier <a href="http://localhost:4000/thoughts/2016/12/09/what-learn-next.html" target="_blank"> blog post</a>) I started looking for ways to learn more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices" target="_blank"> Microservices</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I found that for many new subjects one of the best approaches to "brake yourself in" is actually watching a good presentation. For the topic of Microservices I have chosen four of such presentations, and after listening to them my mind does not go completely blank when the term "Microservices" is mentioned.
  </p>

  <h4>GOTO 2014 • Microservices • Martin Fowler</h4>
  <p>
    This is <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/" target="_blank">Martin Fowler</a>'s talk from the year 2014. It is relatively shorter (~ 26 mins) than the others I saw (40+ mins), but provides an excellent introduction into the topic. If I had to choose just one talk to watch on the subject - I would choose this one.

  <h4>GOTO 2015 • Microservices @ Spotify • Kevin Goldsmith</h4>
  <p>
    This presentation explains how microservices work in big internet company, but also shares the details on the intricacies of software development process in <a href="https://www.spotify.com/" target="_blank"> Spotify</a>.

  <h4>GOTO 2016 • The Idiot’s Guide to Quashing Microservices • Hani Suleiman</h4>
  <p>
    This talk concentrates on more practical aspects of the challenges  with which teams are faced before and after moving to Microservices architecture, for example:

    <ul class="icon-list list-unstyled">
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> security; </li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> logging and monitoring; </li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> integration testing; </li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> availability and performance, etc. </li>
    </ul>

    The author suggests the strategies and specific tools for many of the mentioned chalenges.

  <h4>GOTO 2016 • Pragmatic Microservices • Randy Shoup</h4>
  <p>
    Randy Shoup talks about why sucessful technology startups did not start with Microservices-basesd applications and why planning for Microservices from the start might not be a good idea. Also he gives an advice on how to approach moving from a single monolith architecture to number of independent services.
