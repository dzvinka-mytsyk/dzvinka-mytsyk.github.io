    "Product Managers are often considered the “CEO of a product”, and just like successful CEOs, successful data-driven product managers need a variety of different tools, skills, and capabilities that cut across many domains."

    I am a long time Android fan. Since it came about I newer used any other type of smartphone: not iPhone, not BlackBerry, not Windows phone, not even Ubuntu phone (though I am a loooong time a happy user of Desktop Ubuntu).
