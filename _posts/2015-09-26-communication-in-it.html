<p class="blog-emphasis">
  The topic of effective communication is very dear to me, especially when it's discussed in the context of IT. I feel like it is an untapped resource which (when used wisely) will significantly increase value in our projects.
</p>
<p>
  I see many-many topics related to communication to be discussed in this blog in future.
</p>
<p>
  But we'll start with the basics today just to make sure they are covered.
</p>
<p>
  On the Smashing Magazine website I found a very
  <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/06/communicating-effectively-in-projects/">useful article</a> written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/krzysztof-rakowski/1/a24/b57 ">Krzysztof Rakowski </a>.
  I even created a <a href="{{ page.downloadUrl }}">PDF copy</a> of it in case something were to happen with online version.
</p>
<p>
 This article can be used as a basic level standard for any IT team as well as in introduction training for new team members.
</p>
<p>
 Author provides practical suggestions for three areas of work-related communication: email, issue-tracking systems and meetings. Below I am going to summarise the most important points:
</p>
<p>
  <h4>Email:</h4>
    <ul class="icon-list blog-list">
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> Take extra care to make email subject line clear. A clear subject quickly tells the recipient the contents of the message and whether they need to respond in any way.</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> Avoid changing the topic of conversation during an email thread: either change the subject line or send a separate email.</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> Use CC and To fields appropriately. Involve only the people who are necessary to move something forward. Don’t waste anyone else’s time.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <h4>Issue-tracking systems:</h4>
    <ul class="icon-list blog-list">
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> Have all tasks in issue-tracking system. No exceptions.</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> Avoid sending the details of the issue in the separate email. Always do it inside the issue. Your system can be nicely integrated with email so your email response automatically appends to issue discussion and does not get lost.</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> Title each issue as descriptively as possible. Provide as much information as possible in the description fields.</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> Write about only one thing per issue.</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> Set relationships between issues.</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> Write down in the comments section everything that happens with an issue. If someone explains something to you by phone or if a task is changed, document it.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <h4>Meetings:</h4>
    <ul class="icon-list blog-list">
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> Call a meeting only if absolutely necessary.</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> Prepare an agenda.</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> Stick to the agenda.</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> If possible, don't try to figure out solutions during the meeting, but rather assign responsible people to prepare proposed solutions beforehand and just make decisions on them (solutions) after a brief discussion.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
  These suggestions may seem obvious to many, but they still cannot be called a "second nature in communication" for many IT teams. That's why it felt important to acknowledge and reiterate them, to be able to discuss more advanced concepts in future.
