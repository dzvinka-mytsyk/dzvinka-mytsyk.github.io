    <ul class="icon-list list-unstyled">
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> Microservices</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> No SQL</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> Containers (Docker, etc.)</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> Serverless Architecture</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> Federated architecture</li>
    </ul>
