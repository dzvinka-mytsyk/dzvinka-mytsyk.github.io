<p class="blog-emphasis">
  While reading Josh Kaufman's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591845572">"The Personal MBA: Master the Art of Business"</a> I stumbled upon a chapter which I think would be very useful for every Product Manager, especially a "junior" kind.
</p>
<p>
  When we work on the product development - we work to deliver Value. And to do it successfully we need a crystal clear understanding of what Value really is and in what forms it comes.  A chapter called <a href="http://personalmba.com/12-standard-forms-of-value/">"12 Standard Forms of Value"</a> is exactly about that. As usual I created a <a href="{{ page.downloadUrl }}">PDF copy</a> of it in case something were to happen with an online version.
</p>

<p>
So, according to Josh Kaufman, there are 12 basic forms of Value which we can use to define what is exactly the Value which our product is meant to deliver. Obviously, different groups of customers might get different types of Value, as well as one product can "group" several types of Value in itself.
</p>

<p>
In this case it becomes ever so important to be familiar with each type of Value in its pure definition to be able to track that each and every one of them in every intended combination is being delivered to designated group of users.
</p>

<p>
So, without further ado...
</p>
<p>
  <h4>12 Standard Forms of Value:</h4>

  <ul class="icon-list list-unstyled">
    <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> <b>Product</b> - Create a single tangible item or entity, then sell and deliver it for more than what it cost to make.</li>
    <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> <b>Service</b> - Provide help or assistance then charge a fee for the benefits rendered.</li>
    <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> <b>Shared Resource</b> - Create a durable asset that can be used by many people, then charge for access.</li>
    <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> <b>Subscription</b> - Offer a benefit on an ongoing basis, and charge a recurring fee.</li>
    <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> <b>Resale</b> - Acquire an asset from a wholesaler, then sell that asset to a retail buyer at a higher price.</li>
    <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> <b>Lease</b> - Acquire an asset, then allow another person to use that asset for a pre-defined amount of time in exchange for a fee.</li>
    <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> <b>Agency</b> - Establish a new relationship between a seller and a buyer for a commission fee.</li>
    <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> <b>Audience Aggregation</b> - Market and sell an asset or service you donâ€™t own on behalf of a third-party, then collect a percentage of the transaction price as a fee.</li>
    <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> <b>Loan</b> - Lend a certain amount of money, then collect payments over a pre-defined period of time equal to the original loan plus a pre-defined interest rate.</li>
    <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> <b>Option</b> - Offer the ability to take a pre-defined action for a fixed period of time in exchange for a fee.</li>
    <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> <b>Insurance</b> - Take on the risk of some specific bad thing happening to the policy holder in exchange for a pre-defined series of payments, then pay out claims only when the bad thing actually happens.</li>
    <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> <b>Capital</b> - Purchase an ownership stake in a business, then collect a corresponding portion of the profit as a one-time payout or ongoing dividend.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

Let's think about some examples from real life. For instance, my favourite meditation app <a href="https://www.headspace.com/"> Headspace</a> is a <b>Subscription</b> while my local yoga class is a <b>Service</b>, and renting a room in a gym for that class for an hour is a <b>Shared Resource</b>. In that gym they also sell botles of water which is a <b>Resale</b>. And if after a meditation I would feel a bit lightheaded - on reception they can call me a taxi, which is a <b>Service</b>, but they would do it for free. I mean "calling a taxi" is for free :) An actual taxi (which is a <b>Service</b> and maybe also a <b>Shared resource</b> of a car) will cost me 10 euro plus a tip :)
