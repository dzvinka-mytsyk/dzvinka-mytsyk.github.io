  <p class="blog-emphasis">
    In this post I will review couple of reasons of why I think that IT is such a good gig.
  </p>
  <p class="blog-emphasis">
    I have been working in IT for more then 10 years now, with two relatively short brakes into other
    industries. Also being business analyst helped because it allowed me not just a glimpse into different business domains.

    This made me appreciate working in IT teams so much more and fully understand the perks.
    Let me now share them with you ...
  </p>
  <h4>
    Fist of all, <b>PEOPLE</b>
  </h4>
  <p>
    When you work in IT you work with exceptionally smart people. On the average guys in good software development team
    will be sooo much smarter than your other alternatives. I think this is becase ...
    <ul class="icon-list list-unstyled">
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> to get the interest in "all things technical" and to keep it going sometimes for decades</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> to endure years of Computer Sience education and continue active self-education for the length of etire career</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> to grasp all those complex and abstract mathematical and algorithmic concepts</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> and still be able to turn arround and apply them to fix "down to earth" problems</li>
    </ul>

  </p>
  <p>
    ... to do all that and more - you really have to be smart.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Second: <b>PROCESSES</b>
  </h4>
  <p>
    In IT we do everything according to very well defined processes, wheather it's some sub-class of Agile or CMMI or ITIL or some other well considered choice.
    <ul class="icon-list list-unstyled">
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> When we finish one sub-task - we always know what to do next.</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> Our tasks are all in tracking systems.</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> Our issues are moving forward and being resolved according to clear workflows.</li>
        <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> Our atrifacts are in version control so they are never "accidentally" destroyed.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, thanks to processes, nothing in our world is forgotten, lost for no reason or done "because I said so".
    And if something does happen, in most cases it would be because someone violated the process or (rarely) because process was not adequately defined.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course we are always free to update any process if we make a compelling case that the change will benefit the project. And since IT guys so are smart - they will newer turn down resonable proposals. Because it wouldn't be smart, whould it?
  </p>
  <h4>
    Third: IT is not about <b>INTERPRETATIONS</b>
  </h4>
  <p>
    In Polytology or Art, Economics or History you might find the "room for opinions or open interpretation based on nothing". But in most cases in IT stuff is truly discrete - things either work or not, compile or not, run or not.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of cource, there are still places for "opinions", like during the refctoring or choosing the framework, but:
    <ul class="icon-list list-unstyled">
      <li><i class="ion-checkmark-round"></i> people in IT much more often tend to settle those differences using discrete quantified methods. Which I think is again because guys and girls in IT are freaking smart.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h4>
  Fourth: fewer <b>POLITICS</b>
  </h4>
  <p>
    Thanks to lack of interpretation, it always easier to make one's point based on obvious "stuff working or not".
  </p>
  <p>
    Since majority of disputs are settled with cool language of numbers, there are significantly less ways for anyone
    to get any sort of power in the team using anything other than concrete results and merits.
  </p>
  <p>
    And overall IT-guys seem to be so much less interested in any power struggles. Probably because they can show off their self importance in much more constructive ways. Like in working software. Or in several cool pull requests into chosen open source project.
  </p>
  <h4>
  And numbers Five and Six: <b>ABSTRACTIONS</b> and <b>AESTETICS</b>
  </h4>
  <p>
  Creating or understanding good and appropriate software design includes undeniable aestetic aspects. Wisely made IT-solutions are elegant and beautiful. And to appreciate them fully one should also be able to work with certain degree of abstraction.
  </p>
  <p>
   To some extend, software development can be viewed as some sort of "hidden beauty appreciation society". "Hidden" because because you have to be "one of us" to see it.

    That's it for now, but I'm sure in time more reasons like these will pop in my head. I even envision a "Part Two" of this post :)
