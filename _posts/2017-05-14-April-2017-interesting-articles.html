    April wasn't my best reading month of the year, that's for sure! But I still managed to find and share some gems of the knowledge, this time it is about stakeholders management and being a better PM.

    There are many articles and publications where authors share their view on what makes good and bad Product Managers. I like reading them from time to time because they inspire me to research some new topics and make improvements to my own Product Management and analysis methods. This next article is a good one on a subject!

  Stakeholders management is one of the key aspects in any project, and the following blog post is full of very useful and insightful tips, which I will definitely turn into some sort of checklist and will apply in my everyday practice.

    I particularly liked this following suggestion: "The first step in negotiation is to be strict about who your stakeholders really are.
</p>

<p>
    Some of the most complex products I have worked on have just a handful of stakeholders – three or five maybe. There are lots of people who have opinions, want to interfere or who like the sound of their own voice – but this doesn’t make them stakeholders."
