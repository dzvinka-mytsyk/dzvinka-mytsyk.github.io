    Last months were so busy that time just to flew by: it's already the middle of April, and I still have yet to publish my "best articles" for the last winter month. So I have decided to combine February and March together, and the list is still not that long ;)

    The first article is essentially a list of potential time wasters in Product Manager's life.

  I particularly liked the following quote: "We spend lots of time as PMs persuading people we have things figured out even when we don’t. That’s partially because they are risk averse. And that is partially because we create a conveyor belt of features and need to keep things rolling off the line. Instead of saying “hey, let’s get something in front of customers, and we can kill it if it doesn’t work” we say something like “ok, it looks like we all agree on the direction here, let’s ship it.” Consider how much time you invest keeping up the illusion that you know everything."
